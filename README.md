# craigscheck.rb
A quick ruby script to search the Craigslist website for things

If you use this script, you may want to change the location of the YAML file from the 
current directory to a specific location.  Otherwise, you cannot move it to
a nice location in your path and expect it to run.

This script was tested on Ruby 2.2.0.
